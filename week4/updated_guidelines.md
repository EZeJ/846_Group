### Guideline 6: Use Structured and Standardized Role Formatting for Multi-Speaker Content

**Description:**

When providing conversations, transcripts, interviews, chats, or debates to an LLM, clearly structure speaker roles using consistent, high-visibility formatting.

Capitalizing role names helps, but for analytical tasks it is often not sufficient on its own.
Whenever the task depends on tracking viewpoints, responsibility, or technical reasoning, use structured role formatting such as JSON or tagged dialogue. 

**Reasoning:***
When reading transcripts, LLMs can sometimes misclassify which person was responsible for saying what, which leads to all sorts of errors [3]. However, if speaker boundaries are weak or visually similar to the surrounding text, the model may:

Blend perspectives
Attribute arguments to the wrong person
Lose track of stance over time
Produce generic or inaccurate summaries
