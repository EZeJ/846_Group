User: I have week5/resources/updated_guideline5/auth_reset.py and you should Write a short docstring summary for verify_reset_token focusing on the high-level purpose.
Avoid implementation details such as hashing/HMAC and internal storage. Keep it to 1–2 sentences.

GitHub Copilot: Plan:
- Draft a concise 1–2 sentence docstring for `verify_reset_token`.
- Provide the exact text for insertion into auth_reset.py.

Docstring to insert:
"""
Verifies a password reset token and returns the associated user ID if valid.
"""
